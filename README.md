# VAE-generative-temperature-signal-for-CFRP-plate
Utilizing OpenGuided Waves dataset, this project involves pitch-catch values corresponding to Lamb waves on a carbon fiber plate at various temperatures. Implementing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), the aim is to generate missing signals in the dataset based on user input for the desired temperature.
